    At {{ site.title }} we have a little bit of everything when it comes to livestock. Once in a while we'll have some great family milk cows, dairy goats,
    Scotch Collies, or registered Dexter cattle for sale. 
    
    Check out the 
    <a href="for_sale.html">For Sale</a>
    page for more details on that. Otherwise checkout some of the info
    about the farm with the links below.
