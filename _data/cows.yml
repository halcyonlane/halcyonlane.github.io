    Shadow is a "Guernster" cow that is one of our family milk cows. She is a cross between our purebred Guernsey (Kora) and 
    our purebred Dexter (LLF Mickey's Rudy). We think these Guernsters are great family milk cows. 
    They have a great dispostion and a great balance between milk production, size, and maintainability. Shadow produces
    between 1 and 2 gallons of milk for us, milking just once a day. If you need some help leaning the ropes for milking, we can help!
